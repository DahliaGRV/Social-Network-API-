## Installation
In order for this program to work, the user will need to run npm install to install all of the packages listed in the package.json file. Then the user will want to run the seeds with npm run seed. Last the user will want to either use the routes provided in Insomnia or a similar application. 

## Usage
This project will be used as a skeleton backend for a pretty simple social network start. It would be perfect for a neighborhood book club.

## Summary
This was my first time using MongoDB and it was challenging to me that seeds need to be manually put into the corresponding tables if they are not directly putting data into that table itself. For example, the thoughts need to be put in manually even though the thought table knows which username they belong to.
